Zero-Trust Function Mesh (ZTFM) is a cutting-edge framework designed to address the unique security challenges of serverless architectures. By leveraging dynamic sidecar provisioning, horizontal token cache scaling, and stateless policy distribution, ZTFM ensures secure and efficient scaling of serverless functions while maintaining low-latency performance.

## Overview

Serverless architectures offer significant benefits in terms of scalability and cost-efficiency. However, they also introduce unique security challenges, especially concerning elasticity and dynamic scaling. ZTFM addresses these challenges through three core mechanisms:

- **Dynamic Sidecar Provisioning**: Ensures that no function executes without a security proxy.
- **Horizontal Token Cache Scaling**: Implements a sharded Redis cluster with consistent hashing and predictive scaling for efficient token validation.
- **Stateless Policy Distribution**: Propagates security policies globally with eventual consistency guarantees.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Sidecar Injection**: Automatically injects security proxies during function initialization to maintain security guarantees.
- **Predictive Cache Scaling**: Utilizes a novel approach with sharded Redis clusters and consistent hashing to handle traffic bursts efficiently.
- **Incremental Policy Verification**: Ensures global policy propagation with minimal latency using a versioned, conflict-free schema.
- **Runtime Invariant Checking**: Continuously validates critical invariants during runtime to maintain safety properties.
